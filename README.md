# Linfo - Server stats library

### Linfo is a:
 - Extensible, easy (composer) to use PHP Library to get extensive system stats programmatically from your PHP app

### Fork changes:
- drop ui
- drop internationalization
- drop bsd* support (sorry, I will not be able to support)
- no need `COM` extension on Windows, but need powershell
- minimal windows 10 support
- minor code improvements
- minimal php version 7.1


### PHP library usage

```bash
composer require gemorroj/linfo
```

```php
<?php
$linfo = new \Linfo\Linfo();
$linfo->scan();
$info = $linfo->getInfo();

print_r($info); // and a whole lot more
```
